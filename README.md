# Pokemon Trainer App

Pokemon trainer app is an Angular framework specific frontend project for Noroff accelerate course studies.

#Assignment: Create a Pokemon Trainer App Single Page Application using Angular

The app takes users username and routes the user to the Pokemon catalogue. If user is already in the database, user goes on to Pokemon catalogue page. If not, user gets added to database and then goes on to Pokemon cataloque page. The user then has a chance to catch as many pokemon as wanted from the original 151 pokemon displayed on page, and see all the catched pokemon in trainer page. The user can also "transfer"/delete pokemon from the collection. The info is provided by pokeapi.co and images from github.com/PokeAPI.
